    <p style="background-color: white;">Oh hello person howdy! Yeah so basically let me tell some things about me. First I made AI look (this website) when I was 10 yrs old! Yeah 10 yrs old but it wasn't like I was so interested and started learning coding all by my self. I had coding classes! Yeah you read that right! So basically I would do coding classes then I would have projects after class (meaing of project: coding homework I got to do after class) so and if you haven't experienced "coding" then you don't know how it feels. But it sure is fun! you imagining gaining money living in a mansion with cool cars! Well coding "can" make you rich enough for that but. You need to have patience cause coding is not like you made a great website and in 1 second 8 billion people buy from your website and BOOM YOUR RICH no you need to have patience but it can make you a millionare but to earn that much money you need to have "patience". it could take you years to be a millionare but it can take you less than a month or week or day or hours? well max years and if I had to guess minimum I think it would be a year. But o'well back on more about me so I made AI look cuase I thought it would be funny calling someone "you look bad" hehehe oh no laughing time! Yeah so that's why I made AI look and I knew that it would turn out good I mean I was thinking that people will make like shorts of trying this website out but then getting roasted badly! </p>
